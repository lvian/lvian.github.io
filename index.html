        <p>In this page I showcase games and prototypes I worked on, ordering from oldest to latest projects. More details in each project section, but as an overall I worked as programmer and game designer for all of them, but as happens in most indie projects I ended up having to wear all the hats related to game developing. All the codes to each project is hosted here on github an can be accessed and used by anyone.</p>

        <h3></h3>


        <!-- Sturdy Defenders -->
        <h2>Sturdy Defenders</h2>
        <p>Sturdy Defenders was the first project I focused on after starting collage, spending a lot of hours in this project that span a bit over one year in total.</p>

        <p>This game is a 3D tower defense with a steam punk theme, it was planed to have a 3 levels, 4 types of towers and 4 types enemies. The scope was meant to be small, allowing us to acquire some experience, but unfortunatly the artists involved could no longer dedicate time to the project and so we stopped a bit short from the goals we had.</p>

        <p>The game was developed using Unity3D 3.4 with the Unity WebPlayer in mind, since browsers no longer support NPAPI I imported the project in the recent version 5 of Unity, I had to fix some compatibility bugs but it worked, allowing to make some screenshots.</p>

        {% include slider.html selector="sd_slider" %}

		<p>Overall it's a very crude project, but was an oportunity to learn and experience aspects of game programming that I would not have seen in regular web or software development, such as :</p>        

        <ul>
          <li>Game State controll, level transition and persistance</li>
          <li>Wave Systems</li>
          <li>Enemy Controll, statistics(speed, resistance and health), state controll and animations,
          <li>Waypoint system, guiding enemies trough the different paths in each stage.</li></li>
          <li>Tower Systems, with a grid of spots to build, construction and destruction.</li>
          <li>Tower Controll, statistics(damage, price, range), animations, guns aiming at enemies and target aquiring based on event system.
          <li>Design patterns, such as factory and singleton.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the full Unity3D code in C# check out <a href="https://github.com/lvian/Tower-Defense-Bagual">Sturdy Defenders</a>.</p>

		 <h2>What will code look like?</h2>

		<p>Your code should be beautiful, or at least that's what the designers think. </p>

		<div class="highlight">
		<pre><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'adapter/memory'</span>
		<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'toystore'</span>

		<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span>
		  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Toy</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Store</span>
		  <span class="n">adapter</span> <span class="ss">:memory</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

		  <span class="n">attribute</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">String</span>
		<span class="k">end</span>
		</pre>
		</div>


		<p>So, this is what HTML Code looks like</p>

		<div class="highlight">
		<pre><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
		   <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
		      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"header"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
		          <span class="nt">&lt;nav&gt;</span>
		             <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Home<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
		             <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>About Us<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
		             <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Contact<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
		          <span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
		      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
		   <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
		</pre>
		</div>


		<p>And, then maybe some CSS</p>

		<div class="highlight">
		<pre><span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		  <span class="k">font</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">14px</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">22px</span> <span class="s1">'Quattrocento Sans'</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s2">"Helvetica Neue"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Helvetica</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Arial</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">#666</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">300</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0px</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">0px</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">20px</span> <span class="m">0px</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">background</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="sx">url(../images/body-background.png)</span> <span class="m">#eae6d1</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="p">}</span>

		<span class="nt">h1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h3</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h4</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h5</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h6</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		  <span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">#333</span><span class="p">;</span>
		  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="p">}</span>

		<span class="nt">p</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">ul</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">ol</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">table</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">pre</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">dl</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">20px</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="p">}</span>
		</pre>
		</div>

        <p>Inline code would look a little different. <code>We want you to see</code> where it is, but its going to be a little less noticeable. It might also be as simple as <code>:hover</code> and as unique as <code>:first-child</code>. It is up to you. </p>
